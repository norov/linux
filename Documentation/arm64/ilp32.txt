ILP32 AARCH64 SYSCALL ABI
=========================

This document describes the ILP32 syscall ABI and where it differs
from the generic compat linux syscall interface.

Syscalls which normally would pass 64bit values as two arguments;
now pass the 64bit value as one argument. Next syscalls are affected:
fadvise64_64,
fallocate,
ftruncate,
lookup_dcookie,
pread64,
pwrite64,
readahead,
shmat,
sync_file_range,
truncate,
lseek,
mmap

struct rt_sigframe is redefined and contains struct compat_siginfo,
as compat syscalls expects, and struct ilp32_sigframe, to handle
AARCH64 register set and 32-bit userspace register representation.
